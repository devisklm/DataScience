# Online Payment Fraud Detection System
Project Aim :-The project aims to build a Online Payment Fraud Detection Model. I use the
features and their labels as fraud or No fraud to detect if new transactions made by the 
customer are fraud are not.

Input :- type,amount,Org_oldbalance,Dest_newbalance.

Output :- Fraud or NoFraud

Introduction:-
 Online payment systems has helped a lot in the ease of payments. But, at the same 
time, it increased in payment frauds. Online payment frauds can happen with anyone using 
any payment system, especially while making payments using a credit card. That is why 
detecting online payment fraud is very important for credit card companies to ensure that the 
customers are not getting charged for the products and services they never paid.

About the Dataset:-
For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about 
fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all 
the columns from the dataset Iâ€™m using here:
1. type: type of online transaction
2. amount: the amount of the transaction
3. nameOrig: customer starting the transaction
4. oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction
5. newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction
6. nameDest: recipient of the transaction
7. oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction
8. newbalanceDest: the new balance of recipient after the transaction
9. isFraud: fraud transaction
